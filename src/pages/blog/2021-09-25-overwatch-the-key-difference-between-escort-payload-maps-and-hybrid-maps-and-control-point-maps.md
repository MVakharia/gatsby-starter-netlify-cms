Going forward into 5v5, we're going to see the three 'off-tank' heroes being played as solo tanks: that is, Zarya, Roadhog, and D.Va. These tanks rely on natural cover as opposed to being able to use a barrier shield (or in Wrecking Ball's case, his temporary shields), which makes them better suited to stages of the game where a payload is in play, as it's a moving piece of natural cover.

They're also well suited to control point maps that fulfil both of the following requirements:

* They don't require the team to push exclusively through small choke points
* The control point isn't a wide open space, but provides lots of natural cover

In maps that have the following, a shield tank would be more beneficial:

* Smaller choke points
* Control points with no natural cover
