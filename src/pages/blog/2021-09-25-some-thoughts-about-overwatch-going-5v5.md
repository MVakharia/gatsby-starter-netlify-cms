**Every healer combination will become viable, including Lucio + Zenyatta.** 

With 2-2-2, any two tanks and any two damage heroes can be played together and accomplish something. However, it's not the same for the support lineup: regardless of how well the rest of the team is playing, there will always be a healing deficiency if the 'right' support heroes aren't picked, as they're having to support 2 tanks with large health pools. It goes against every player's right to play whatever they like. If a Support player picks Lucio or Zenyatta, the other is at the very least forced to pick a support with a lot of single-target healing (and in the case of having Zen for a partner, mobility), otherwise they're essentially soft-throwing the game.

When you drop this down to a single tank, you're reducing the strain on the Support lineup considerably. Sure, the single target healing output isn't going to exceed 50HP/s without the use of Lucio's Amp It Up, but with the combination of Speed Song and Orb of Discord, Lucio + Zenyatta is a risky, but ultimately dangerous lineup in the hands of Support players who can hit their shots consistently. You've also got the added benefit of having 2 forms of protection against ultimate abilities like Dragonblade (nano-boosted or not), Minefield, Gravitic Flux, Graviton Surge + Dragonstrike, Molten Core, and Tactical Visor.

**Healing will be toned down (on post-release Support heroes)**

With the removal of a second tank, here are a couple of predictions for heroes in the Support role:

Moira: 

* Biotic Orb (Healing) reduced from 300 to 250.

Ana: 

* Clip size reduction

**DPS Queue times will go right down.**



**Teamfights will be less cluttered**



**More emphasis will be placed on individual performance**



**Burst damage will be scaled back in favour of consistent damage**



**The tank role will become more popular, as tanks will be superpowered in comparison to their current state.**



**The universally-hated flanking Roadhog will likely become a thing of the past, as Roadhog will need to focus more on maintaining frontline presence.**

* You won't see DPS players queueing tank just so that they can play damage-heavy tanks.
